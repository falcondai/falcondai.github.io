title: Remote Teaching with an iPad
date: 2020-03-16

As many schools moved classes online during the COVID-19 outbreak, I think a review of solutions for remote instructions will be helpful. I am not aware of an one-stop solution and established video conferencing tools seem to be the go-to methods. This article will focus on a specific desideratum particularly relevant for math-heavy disciplines: **blackboard (whiteboard)**. Drawing with a stylus is easily the most intuitive hardware solution since I failed to master writing equations with a cursor.

Assuming that you are (luckily) stuck with an iPad like I do, here are some apps and tips that can turn it into an effective _infinite_ blackboard (without dust or odor).

## Google Meet

This is a business-oriented version of Google Hangout which requires a [paid](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/03/enabling-hangouts-meet-premium-features.html) G-Suite subscription for hosting.

1. Install the Google Meet iOS [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hangouts-meet-by-google/id1013231476#?platform=ipad).
2. Create a meeting on your _laptop_ at https://meet.google.com. (You can only join an existing meeting from the iOS app.)
3. Follow [instructions](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308856?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en) to screen share.
4. Open the built-in Notes app or an alternative to draw.


## Zoom

You need to first install the Zoom iOS [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zoom-cloud-meetings/id546505307#?platform=ipad). Then there are three different approaches.

- [Screen share](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing) and use a familiar app such as the built-in Notes to draw. I strongly prefer this approach.
- Use the built-in Zoom [whiteboard](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard) feature to draw. You can usefully divided the content into multiple whiteboards. However, I found that the rendering style of strokes makes letters hard to read and the whiteboards disappear when you tap `stop share` (perhaps to switch to a different content).
- Install [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting) on your computer and share the iPad's screen when hosting on the computer. Impressively, the iPad can [connect](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-iOS-Screen-Sharing-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client) to the host computer _wirelessly_ via AirPlay (or with a USB cable).

## Some tips

1. Mute all banner notifications during presentations (you can still find them in the notification center). They are distracting and potentially embarrassing. Set `SILENCE` to `Always` in the [Do Not Disturb settings](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321) and turn on `Do Not Disturb`.
2. Record your presentations for post-mortem analysis.
3. Share the recorded presentations to students. They can focus more on the content and worry less about note taking.
4. You can double-join the same meeting with another device (laptop/desktop) to keep slides or a PDF up along with your blackboard drawings. Make sure to mute one of the devices. (Not sure if the recording will work)
5. Test your audio/video in-app before starting/joining a meeting.
6. Present and live annotate your slides to better leverage content already on the slides.


## Extra features and comparisons

A few nonessential features that may warrant some consideration.

1. **Recording** is limited on both Meet and Zoom. It can only be initiated by hosts on a computer for both apps. However, you can record to local in Zoom with the [free edition](https://zoom.us/pricing) (which has a 40-minute per meeting limit) whereas Meet may require the organization admin's help to [enable recording](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7557052).
2. Zoom has a neat **hand raising** feature which might help the host better coordinate Q&A's.
3. **Auto live caption** might help make your lectures more accessible to some students.
